<body lang="en-US" dir="ltr"><p align="center">Hello and welcome to
my humble blog. I seek to write mostly on Philosophy and potentially
also on math, economics along with any other topic that comes across
my mind. This blog is mostly for me to practice my writing then it is
for any particular reader. I plan to upload my thoughts as PDF’s so
that LLM can not so easily read it. For now the blog is empty but I
hope to soon upload PDF’s and add comments. Thank you for your
time.
